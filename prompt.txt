1. A tailored resume (clean text, match keywords) ATS  and recrueitment Friendly, no buzzwords, no repetitive words. As human-like as possible to avoid ATS and AI detection.

Adjust your style based on the job post—use its tone, whether it’s professional, casual, or imaginative. 

Use every keyword from the job description wisely and strategically. Include each technical term, technical skill, hard skill, and soft skill mentioned—naturally and in context. Don’t force them; work them in where they make sense. 

Also, please read this text and correct any misspelled words. 
2. A cover letter (3 paragraphs, formal) also that will adhere and address the mentioned points before 
3. A short email to send with the application also that will adhere and address the mentioned points before 

Align skills with the job.
